A Database migration strategy helps to avoid creating a poor experience that often generates more issues than it solves.

How do you move millions of records, each entry representing a user's aspirations, into a new database? Without any downtime? AND without any mistakes…
Luckily, there are different methods to choose from. Here are two of them, a simple one and a complex one. Check them out and find the one that suits your needs. 

🖋️𝐁𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 (Requires downtime) :
It is simple but you have to afford for downtime. Below are steps to follow the approach.
1. Stop the existing DB. 
2. This fails all incoming requests to the DB (You should probably have some email communication setup beforehand to notify users of a planned outage). 3. Take a Data Dump of the current DB into your shiny new DB. 
4. When the process completes, point the existing servers to the new DB. This will take a deployment or a server restart.

It is complex, but you will happy that you are not affording huge downtime.
1. Set up a change data capture solution (Similar to a SQL trigger). 
2. Take a database copy of all older records. 
3. Setup a view or proxy to serve existing clients through the old database. 
4. Set the clients to point to the proxy. 
5. Now point the proxy to the new database. 
6. Point clients to the new database directly (this requires a deployment or server restart). 
7. Delete the proxy. 

Yey! Remember, despite our best efforts, there is always a chance of a data miss. It's best to check for correctness after deployment.
