API design is the deliberate process of deciding how an API will provide access to its data and functions. It's crucial for ensuring that APIs are easy to use, adaptable, and well-documented. The process involves defining endpoints, methods, and resources in a standardized format. API design supports the API-first development model, where APIs are designed before building applications, improving quality and usability.

Design-first becomes clearer when you consider the alternative. If you go straight into building your API, there‚Äôs no returning to design. That‚Äôs like constructing a house and then going to an architect to draw up plans. It just makes no sense.
Creating an API spec before writing code allows for early feedback, seamless integration with tools, and collaboration across teams. Knowing your API's users enables you to share details, prototype, and generate mock servers for live testing. Collaboration extends beyond technical teams, encompassing insights from various departments for a holistic approach.

Key stages of API design include:
1. Define the API's purpose: Align stakeholders on the business use case to outline specific goals and implications for architecture. üéØ
2. Create an API contract: Decide on resources, data formatting, methods, and relationships, capturing decisions in a human- and machine-readable API definition adhering to specifications like OpenAPI. üìù
3. Validate with mocks and tests: Generate mock servers to confirm functionality and conduct tests to catch issues early, ensuring the API works as intended. üõ†Ô∏è
4. Document the API: Write clear documentation detailing resources, methods, parameters, and examples, facilitating quick adoption by consumers and ensuring alignment with the design. üìö

API Design Best Practices:
1. Prioritize consistency: Establish organization-wide standards for naming conventions, methods, endpoints, and resources to ensure a cohesive API experience.
2. Gather input from every stakeholder: Include domain-specific knowledge from all stakeholders to address diverse perspectives and avoid communication gaps.
3. Understand the API's context and constraints: Consider project timelines, system limitations, and expected traffic volumes to make informed design decisions that align with project goals.
4. Set rate limitations: Control the number of requests per timeframe to maintain API reliability and availability, and prevent DDoS attacks.
5. Configure CORS settings: Specify which domains can access your API to enhance web security and prevent unwanted cross-site interactions.

These practices ensure effective communication, adherence to standards, and informed decision-making throughout the process.
