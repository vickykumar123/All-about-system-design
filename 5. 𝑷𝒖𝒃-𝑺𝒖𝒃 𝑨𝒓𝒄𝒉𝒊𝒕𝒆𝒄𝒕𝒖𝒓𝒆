Imagine you have a newspaper delivery service where subscribers (customers) subscribe to receive newspapers, and publishers (newspaper companies) publish newspapers. This same for the Pub/Sub architecture.

A Publish­-Subscribe Architecture is a messaging pattern where the publishers broadcast messages, with no knowledge of the subscribers. Similarly the subscribers ‘listen’ out for messages regarding topic/categories that they are interested in without any knowledge of who the publishers are. The event bus transfers the messages from the publishers to the subscribers.

Each subscriber only receives a subset of the messages that have been sent by the publisher; they only receive the message topics or categories they have subscribed to.

1. Loose coupling between components, making your system more modular and flexible.
2. High scalability (in theory, Pub/Sub allows any number of publishers to communicate with any number of subscribers). 
3. Language-agnostic and protocol-agnostic, which makes it straightforward and fast to integrate Pub/Sub into your tech stack. 
4. Asynchronous, event-driven communication that’s ideal for realtime, low-latency apps. 

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐮𝐛/𝐒𝐮𝐛 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤?
1. Publishers create and send messages to topics in the Pub/Sub system.
2. Subscribers express interest in receiving messages from specific topics.
3. Topics categorize messages; publishers send messages to specific topics, and subscribers subscribe to topics to receive messages of interest.
4. Message brokers manage message routing between publishers and subscribers, forwarding messages based on subscriptions.
5. When a message is sent to a topic, the message broker forwards it to all subscribed subscribers.
6. Pub/Sub enables asynchronous communication, allowing publishers to send messages independently of subscriber activity, and subscribers to receive messages without publishers being active.
